This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Elixir when trying to modify a list while iterating over it with `Enum.each`. The function `Enum.each` is designed for side effects, but it doesn't modify the original collection directly.  This can lead to unexpected results if you expect modifications made within the function to reflect in the original data structure. The solution shows how to correctly handle this using `Enum.reduce` or `Enum.filter` to return a modified list.
